# MMC-check-in
A web application using Parse to check in to lessons as a Musical Mentors instructor

It will allow our board to easily see who has actually showed up to 
their lessons for the week, without the hassle of maintaining paper
sign-ins.

So far, I have completed the Parse framework as well as the
initial login, sign up pages and check-in process.

To complete: enhance experience viewing check-ins, add csv list for download
